# shelly-plus-power-profiling
Use the scripting feature of Shelly Plus devices to record power profiles

# Usage

Download the `index.html` file and open it in a web browser. It needs to be a local file to have permission to request data from Shelly devices in your local network.

The `shelly-script.js` file contains the script that needs to be added to the Shelly Plus device (eg. Shelly PlusPlugS) on which the power metering needs to happen.

On the web page, configure the IP address of your Shelly device in your local network (eg. 192.168.1.89) and the script URL.
